------- GYMNASIUM ENVIRONMENT

Action space: which actions can the agent take?

>   In this case, the agent is the player and the player can decide to shoot into 6 different areas:
    [top-left, bottom-left, middle-top, middle-bottom, top-right, bottom-left]

Observation space: what the agent can observe from the environment

------- PYGAME
`pygame.display.set_mode((screen_size, screen_size))`: Create window of specified size
`pygame.display.set_caption("Pygame Clock Example")`: Sets the window title.
`clock = pygame.time.Clock(): Creates a Clock object to manage the frame rate.


------- MAPPING OF PIXELS
Each unit in the observation space corresponds to a certain number of pixels in the Pygame window


------- STRUCTURING SOME THOUGHTS
> Input of this environment: mapping of the goalkeeper from the homographic mapppings from the computer vision model
< Output of this environment: a reinforcement learning model that can simulate Playstation 5 controller feedback

What now if we would:
1. take the input of the mappings of the goalkeeper,
2. transform them to the defined goal sections within this environment,
3. and translate them to goal sections in wording only?

Then out of the wording (top-left, bottom-right, etc.) we could pick a random position in THIS environment
